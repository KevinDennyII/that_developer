                          Network Upgrade for Ideal Nursing Services, Inc.: For
                          this project, I hired two other professionals to
                          assist with taking Ideal Nursing from a wired network
                          to a wireless network. Measurements of the building
                          were taken to create proper network diagrams for
                          approval by Ideal Nursing. Wires were removed and
                          Wireless Access Points (WAPs) were then installed and
                          configured. All machines were upgraded and/or
                          configured to connect to the WAPs. In addition, a new
                          rack with POE ports was installed in their server room
                          for their server, multi-port hub and router. This
                          created a more efficient working space and alleviated
                          unnecessary clutter.
