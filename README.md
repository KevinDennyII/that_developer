Creating my own portfolio site based in ReactJS.

#### Giving some credit to the original idea
The following is a template used to initiate the creation of this portfolio site: https://colorlib.com/preview/#jackson

I am currently in the mode of slowly refactoring the CSS but I think I may eventually scrap this and start from scratch.

#### Resume API
Much of my resume data is coming from https://gitconnected.com where you can create your own resume API for FREE!
SUPPORT this site :-)
